Diplomacy: embassies exist but travel for diplomats is long; conferences are rare and regional.

Trade: international trade volumes are much lower; trade is dominated by staples (food, fuel, raw materials).

Science: breakthroughs still happen but diffuse slowly; no global open-source or cloud-based research.

Warfare: naval and land power dominate; amphibious and blockade operations are decisive because no rapid aerial reinforcement exists.

Everyday life: people rely heavily on local production and markets; news arrives via radio, newspapers, and ships carrying printed goods.
